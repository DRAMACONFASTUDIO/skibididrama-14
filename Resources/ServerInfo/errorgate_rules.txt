PLAYTESTING TIPS:

>> Use your lighter in the separate light slot for seeing in the dark.
>> You can respawn after dying with an action on the bar. If it's not there use /respawn or /rise.
>> [color=#ff0000]YOU WILL DIE OF HUNGER.[/color] Scavenge or cook raw meat on craftable campfires.
>> Butchering humans is a good source of food and equipment too.
>> Running takes stamina, configure your controls in the settings and manage it carefully.
>> You have to take off backpacks and dufflebags to open them, but not to put items in.
>> You can wear most weapons in your back (suit) slot.
>> Melee attacks are combined on LMB, with physical shove on RMB.
>> You can look/aim in the distance by pressing Space.
>> Wide crosshair with guns = bad accuracy. Stay still to hit well.
